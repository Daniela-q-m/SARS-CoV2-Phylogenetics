# SARS-CoV2-Phylogenetics
Phylogenetic Analysis of SARS-CoV2 Sequences, USA!

The objective of this project is to extract, classify and analyze the data of the protein sequence of the SARS-Cov2 from the 1.45GB AllSurfaceGlycoproteinSeqs.fasta file. Using Biopython libraries the ultimate goal is to perform multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis on sequences grouped by geographic regions as determined by the United States Census Bureau. The multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tress that will be obtained will reveal how the virus has evolved due to different kinds of selective pressure and how the virus had spread in different regions based on the actions that have been put in place to mitigate its spread. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90015489/147883908-f7874538-8f47-4d4f-a176-70086dc30ce8.png)
